RViz Stereo Camera Plugin
=========================

This package contains an RViz display plugin which enables the display of stereo camera image streams on 3D display hardware.

It is currently unstable and likes to segfault, but it does the job.

It has been tested with [RViz in stereo](http://wiki.ros.org/rviz/Tutorials/Rviz%20in%20Stereo) using a Quadro FX 4000, Nvidia 3DVision, and an AlienWare display.
